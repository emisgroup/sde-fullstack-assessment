# Story 2

As an General Practitioner,
I want to see the active patient's registration details,
so that I can be certain that I am viewing the correct record and have immediate access to any registration information.

## Acceptance criteria

- I can see the active patient's registration details at all times
- The active patient's registration details are presented consistently at all times, including:
  - Title
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Avatar
  - Date of Birth
  - Contact details
  - Address
- The active patient's registration details do not impair me from viewing the patient's clinical information
