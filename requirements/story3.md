# Story 3

As an General Practitioner,
I want to see the active patient's medication history,
so that I can make an informed decision regarding their medication needs.

## Acceptance criteria

- I can see all medications assigned to the active patient
- By default; the medication history is sorted by `start date DESC`
- The medication history can be sorted by
  - `medication name ASC/DESC`
  - `start date ASC/DESC`
  - `end date ASC/DESC`
